# Apache<sup>&reg;</sup> DataSketches&trade; 
## A software library of stochastic streaming algorithms 

Apache DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences. Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream and provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional, exact methods.

We started this project at Yahoo in 2012 and went open-source in 2015. In December 2020, we became a Top-Level Project at the Apache Software Foundation.
